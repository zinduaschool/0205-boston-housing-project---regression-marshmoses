# Boston-House
Regression Practice Project

In this project, you will use the famous Boston houding prices dataset to develop an indepth understanding of 
1. Exploratory Data analysis 
2. Data Cleaning, specifically, handling missingness in data
3. Feature enginneering - transforming categorical variables for regression problems, outlier detection 
4. Feature Selection - PCA 
5. Regression models 
 
Data Description. 
When buting a house, many people have their own preferences and they probably have neighborhood they would like to live within. Typically, these alongside the house structure itself dictate the selling price of the house. It turns out, much more variables influence the price of a house. 

With abou 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Boston, this challenge provides you with an opportunitu to predict the final score of a house and much more. 

It will call upon you to employ creative feature engineering skills, project understanding and 
advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting. 

This is borroed from Kaggle. Feel free to explore similar notebooks and get to learn the different approaches individuals have used to achieve a better prediction score.
